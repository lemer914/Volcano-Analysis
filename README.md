# Volcano-Analysis
Statistical analysis of volcano data to predict severity of eruptions based on characteristics of the volcanoes.

It was found that Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) does depend on volcano type and world location. Additionally, continental crust volcanoes have eruptions with significantly higher VEI values than oceanic crust volcanoes. Continental crust volcanoes often form at subduction zones, which tend to occur in coastal regions. Therefore, populations living in coastal regions are in danger of more severe volcanic eruptions. ANOVA and difference of two means analysis was done in R.
